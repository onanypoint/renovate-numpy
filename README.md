## Current behavior

Renovate tries to upgrade numpy to version [2.1.1](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/2.1.1/) even though it is incompatible with the python version 3.9.

## Expected behavior

Renovate should upgrade numpy to the lastest valid version which is [2.0.2](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/2.0.2/) relative to the current python version.
